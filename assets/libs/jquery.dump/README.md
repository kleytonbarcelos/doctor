This is a simple plugin for jQuery to dump any object as a nested tree,
returned as a string.

Usage
-----
Once the plugin is loaded, any jQuery object can be dumped by using the
`$( object ).dump()` method. The method is also available as
`$.dump( object )`. In both cases this will return a string with the dump.
